Hibernate,{{SOURCE}},"The content describes the correct usage of the @Find annotation in Hibernate. It states that the return type of a method annotated with @Find must be an entity type E, or one of the specified types. Additionally, the names and types of the parameters of a finder method must exactly match the names and types of persistent fields of the entity type returned by the finder method.","Rule incorrect-use-of-find-annotation {

}","The rule 'incorrect-use-of-find-annotation' checks for incorrect usage of the @Find annotation in Hibernate. It iterates over all classes and their methods. If a method has the @Find annotation, it checks if the return type of the method is one of the specified types. If not, it reports an error message. It also checks if the names and types of the method's parameters match exactly with the names and types of persistent fields of the class. If not, it reports an error message.",,The generated rule seems to be valid as it follows the syntax of RSL and uses only the built-in functions. It checks for the correct usage of the @Find annotation as described in the content from the JetBrains web page.,,,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15431180/configure-error-page-for-pathvariable-type-mismatch; https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/25846; https://medium.com/@AlexanderObregon/the-mechanics-of-request-mapping-in-spring-boot-92d1065cc0ad
