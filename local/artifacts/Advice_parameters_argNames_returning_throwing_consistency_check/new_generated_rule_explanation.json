  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'advice_argNames_consistency_check' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has the '@AspectJ' annotation, it retrieves the value of the 'argNames' attribute. If the 'argNames' attribute is not empty, it asserts that the method has a parameter with the same name as the 'argNames' attribute value. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that the 'argNames' attribute value does not correspond to the actual method parameter name."
