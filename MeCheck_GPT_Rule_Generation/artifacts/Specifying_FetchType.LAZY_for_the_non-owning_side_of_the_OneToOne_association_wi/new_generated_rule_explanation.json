  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'FetchTypeLazyNonOwningOneToOne' checks all classes in the project. If a class has a @OneToOne annotation, it checks all fields of that class. If a field has an annotation attribute 'fetch' with value 'FetchType.LAZY', it asserts that the type of the field is not iterable. If the assertion fails, it means that the field has FetchType.LAZY in a @OneToOne association but it will not affect the loading. The related entity will still be loaded as if FetchType.EAGER is defined. The rule then generates a message with the field name and the fully qualified name of the class."
