Spring MVC,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/SpringMVCInitBinder.html,"The source URL provides information about a specific rule in Spring MVC. The rule states that Controller methods annotated with @InitBinder should be declared as void. If they are not declared as void, it is considered a violation of the rule.","Rule non_void_initbinder_method {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (hasAnnotation(m, '@InitBinder')) {
        assert (getReturnType(m) == 'void') {

        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'non_void_initbinder_method' checks all classes and their methods in the Spring MVC application. If a method is annotated with @InitBinder, it asserts that the return type of the method should be 'void'. If the return type is not 'void', it generates a message indicating the method and class where the violation occurred.",,"The rule 'non_void_initbinder_method' is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses the built-in functions getClasses, getMethods, hasAnnotation, getReturnType, getName, and getFQN, which are all part of the RSL language. The rule does not introduce any new built-in functions.","1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-mvc-custom-data-binder
