}","The rule 'persistent-attribute-signature-checks' checks for each class in the application. For each field in the class, it checks if the field has an 'Embeddable' annotation. If it does, the rule asserts that no attribute name in the annotation exists as a field in the class. If such an attribute exists, it reports an error message. The rule also checks if the field has a 'Persistent' annotation. If it does, the rule asserts that the field type is 'field' or there is a getter method for the field in the class. If not, it reports an error message. The rule also asserts that there is a setter method for the field in the class. If not, it reports an error message.",,The generated rule is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions provided and does not introduce any new functions. The rule checks for the conditions specified in the JetBrains Inspectopedia page.,"1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-entities
Summary: This page provides a comprehensive guide on JPA entities, including the use of annotations such as @Embeddable and @Persistent. It also discusses the importance of getter and setter methods in JPA entities.
