  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'persistent-attribute-signature-checks' checks for each class in the application. For each field in the class, it checks if the field has an 'Embeddable' annotation. If it does, the rule asserts that no attribute name in the annotation exists as a field in the class. If such an attribute exists, it reports an error message. The rule also checks if the field has a 'Persistent' annotation. If it does, the rule asserts that the field type is 'field' or there is a getter method for the field in the class. If not, it reports an error message. The rule also asserts that there is a setter method for the field in the class. If not, it reports an error message."
