Java-TestNG,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/groupsTestNG.html,The source URL provides information about a rule in the Java-TestNG framework that reports undefined group names passed to the dependsOnGroups or groups attributes in the @Test annotation. The quick-fix for this issue is to add the undefined name to a list of known groups.,"Rule undefined-group-name {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (hasAnnotation(m, '@Test')) {
        String[] groups = getAnnoAttr(m, 'groups');
        for (String group in groups) {
          assert ( exists(String knownGroup in getKnownGroups()) ( group == knownGroup ) ) {
            msg(""Undefined group name: %s in method: %s in class: %s"", group, getName(m), getFQN(c));
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'undefined-group-name' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has the '@Test' annotation, it retrieves the 'groups' attribute from the annotation. It then checks each group name against a list of known group names. If a group name does not exist in the list of known groups, it asserts an error and generates a message indicating the undefined group name, the method, and the class where the issue was found.",,"The rule 'undefined-group-name' is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions provided, such as 'getClasses', 'getMethods', 'hasAnnotation', 'getAnnoAttr', 'exists', and 'msg'. The rule does not introduce any new built-in functions.","1.

Summary: This page provides a detailed explanation of how groups work in TestNG, including how to define and use them in @Test annotations. It also discusses the importance of group names, which aligns with the rule generated.
