  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'undefined-group-name' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has the '@Test' annotation, it retrieves the 'groups' attribute from the annotation. It then checks each group name against a list of known group names. If a group name does not exist in the list of known groups, it asserts an error and generates a message indicating the undefined group name, the method, and the class where the issue was found."
