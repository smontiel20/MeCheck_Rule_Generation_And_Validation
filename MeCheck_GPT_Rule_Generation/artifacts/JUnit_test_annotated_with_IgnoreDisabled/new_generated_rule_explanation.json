  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'ignored_or_disabled_junit_test' checks all classes and their methods. If a method is annotated with either '@Ignore' or '@Disabled', it asserts that a reason for the annotation is provided. If no reason is provided, it generates a message indicating the method and class where this code smell is found."
