Spring Core,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/SpringTransactionalComponentInspection.html,The source URL provides information about a JetBrains inspection that reports PlatformTransactionManager classes that are not correctly defined in the application context for the current @Transactional component.,"Rule invalid-transaction-manager-declaration {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (hasAnnotation(c, '@Transactional')) {
      String transactionManager = getAnnoAttr(c, '@Transactional', 'transactionManager');

              transactionManager, getName(c));
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'invalid-transaction-manager-declaration' checks all classes in the application. If a class has the '@Transactional' annotation, it retrieves the 'transactionManager' attribute from the annotation. If the 'transactionManager' attribute is not empty, it asserts that there exists a class in the application with the same name as the 'transactionManager'. If such a class does not exist, it generates a message indicating that the 'PlatformTransactionManager' is not correctly defined in the application context for the '@Transactional' component.",,,"1.
