  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'lombok-setter-may-be-used' checks all classes in the project. For each class, it checks all methods. If a method's name starts with 'set' and the method has a parameter of type 'Object', it asserts that the method has the 'lombok.Setter' annotation. If the method does not have this annotation, it generates a message indicating that the standard setter method can be replaced by the Lombok @Setter annotation."
