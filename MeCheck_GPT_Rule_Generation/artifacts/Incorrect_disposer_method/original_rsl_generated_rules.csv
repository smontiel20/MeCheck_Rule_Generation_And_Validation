CDI,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/CdiDisposerMethodInspection.html,The source URL provides information about a rule that checks for incorrect disposer methods in CDI. The rule states that disposer methods cannot be abstract and must have exactly one disposed parameter annotated with @Disposes.,"Rule incorrect-disposer-method {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (hasAnnotation(m, '@Disposes')) {
        assert (NOT isAbstract(m) AND hasParamType(m, '@Disposes') AND getArg(m) == 1) {
          msg('Incorrect disposer method: %s in class: %s. It is either abstract, does not have exactly one disposed parameter annotated with @Disposes, or both.', getName(m), getFQN(c));
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'incorrect-disposer-method' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has the annotation '@Disposes', it asserts that the method is not abstract, has a parameter type of '@Disposes', and has exactly one argument. If these conditions are not met, it generates a message indicating the incorrect disposer method and the class it belongs to.",,"The rule 'incorrect-disposer-method' is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses the built-in functions 'getClasses', 'getMethods', 'hasAnnotation', 'isAbstract', 'hasParamType', 'getArg', 'getName', and 'getFQN'. No new functions were introduced.","1.

Summary: This page provides a detailed explanation of CDI's producer and disposer methods, including the use of the @Disposes annotation. It explains that a disposer method must have exactly one parameter annotated with @Disposes.
