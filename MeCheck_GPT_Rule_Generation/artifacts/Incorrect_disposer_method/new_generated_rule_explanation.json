  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'incorrect-disposer-method' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has the annotation '@Disposes', it asserts that the method is not abstract, has a parameter type of '@Disposes', and has exactly one argument. If these conditions are not met, it generates a message indicating the incorrect disposer method and the class it belongs to."
