  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'cacheable_and_cacheput_on_same_method' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has both @Cacheable and @CachePut annotations, it asserts that the 'condition' attribute of both annotations should not be true at the same time. If this assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that the method in question uses both @Cacheable and @CachePut annotations, which can lead to unexpected behavior."
