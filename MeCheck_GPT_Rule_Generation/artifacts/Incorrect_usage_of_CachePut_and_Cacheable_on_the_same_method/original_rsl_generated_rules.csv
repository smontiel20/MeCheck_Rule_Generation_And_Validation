Spring Core,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/SpringCacheableAndCachePutInspection.html,"The source URL describes a potential issue in Spring Core where @CachePut and @Cacheable annotations are used on the same method. This can lead to unexpected behavior as @Cacheable skips method execution using the cache, while @CachePut forces execution to update the cache. The page advises against this practice, except in specific cases where conditions in annotations exclude each other. It also notes that such conditions should not rely on the result object (the #result variable) as these are validated upfront to confirm the exclusion.","Rule cacheable_and_cacheput_on_same_method {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (hasAnnotation(m, '@Cacheable') AND hasAnnotation(m, '@CachePut')) {
        assert (NOT (getAnnoAttr(m, '@Cacheable', 'condition') AND getAnnoAttr(m, '@CachePut', 'condition'))) {

}","The rule 'cacheable_and_cacheput_on_same_method' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has both @Cacheable and @CachePut annotations, it asserts that the 'condition' attribute of both annotations should not be true at the same time. If this assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that the method in question uses both @Cacheable and @CachePut annotations, which can lead to unexpected behavior.",,,"1.

Summary: This tutorial on Baeldung provides a comprehensive guide to caching in Spring. It explains the use of @Cacheable and @CachePut annotations, and how they interact with the cache. However, it does not specifically address the issue of using both annotations on the same method.

2. URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10791360/using-cacheable-and-cacheput-in-the-same-method
Summary: This StackOverflow thread discusses the issue of using @Cacheable and @CachePut on the same method. The consensus is that it can lead to unexpected behavior, which aligns with the rule generated by GPT-4.",
