Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/CdiStereotypeInspection.html,"The source URL provides information about a rule in JetBrains Inspectopedia that reports incorrect @Stereotype annotation classes. Specifically, it mentions that non-empty @Named annotations and qualifier annotations are not allowed for stereotypes.","Rule incorrect_stereotype_annotation {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (hasAnnotation(c, '@Stereotype')) {
      if (hasAnnotation(c, '@Named')) {
        String namedValue = getAnnoAttr(c, '@Named', 'value');

}","The rule 'incorrect_stereotype_annotation' checks all classes in the project. If a class has the @Stereotype annotation, the rule checks if it also has a @Named annotation. If it does, the rule asserts that the value of the @Named annotation should be empty. If it's not empty, an error message is generated. The rule also checks all annotations of the class. If any annotation has a 'Qualifier' attribute, an error message is generated because qualifier annotations are not allowed for stereotypes.",,"The generated rule seems to be logically correct and follows the syntax of RSL. It uses the built-in functions getClasses, hasAnnotation, getAnnoAttr, isEmpty, getFQN, and getAnnotated, which are all part of the RSL language. The rule does not introduce any new built-in functions.","1. https://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/latest/en-US/html/annotations.html: This page from JBoss Weld documentation provides a detailed explanation of CDI annotations, including @Stereotype and @Named. It explains that @Stereotype is a marker annotation indicating that an annotated type is a stereotype and that @Named is a qualifier type.
2. https://www.baeldung.com/cdi-qualifiers: This page from Baeldung provides a tutorial on CDI qualifiers. It explains how qualifiers are used to disambiguate beans for injection and how they can be combined with other annotations.",
