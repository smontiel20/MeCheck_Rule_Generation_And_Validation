  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'invalid-sql-and-sqlgroup-configurations' checks each class in the project. If a class has either the @Sql or @SqlGroup annotation, it retrieves the 'scripts' attribute of the annotation, which should contain file paths. It then checks each file path to ensure that it exists. If a file path does not exist, it asserts an error and outputs a message indicating the unresolved file reference and the fully qualified name of the class where the issue was found."
