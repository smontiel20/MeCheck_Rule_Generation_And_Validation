  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'unresolved-json-fields' checks all classes in the project. If a class has the 'org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.Query' annotation, it retrieves the value of the annotation. If the value is not empty, it asserts that there exists a field in the class with the same name as the value of the annotation. If such a field does not exist, it generates a message indicating the unresolved field in the Query annotation."
