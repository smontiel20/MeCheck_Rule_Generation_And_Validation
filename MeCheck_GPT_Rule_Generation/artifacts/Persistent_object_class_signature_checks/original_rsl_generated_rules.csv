Java Persistence API (JPA),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/JpaObjectClassSignatureInspection.html,"The source URL provides information about a JetBrains inspection rule that checks for incorrectly defined persistent object classes in Java Persistence API (JPA).

It asserts that a class is not final, is not annotated multiple times, and is not defined as both a persistent entity and an entity listener. If any of these conditions are not met, a message is generated with the fully qualified name of the class and a description of the issue.",,,"1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-entity-listeners
Summary: This page provides a comprehensive guide on JPA Entity Listeners, which are used for listening to entity lifecycle events. It explains how to define and use them, which is relevant to the rule that checks if a class is defined as both a persistent entity and an entity listener.

Summary: This page provides an introduction to the Java Persistence API (JPA), explaining its purpose, how it works, and how to use it. It is relevant to the rule as it provides context and background information on JPA, which the rule is designed to work with.",,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31403203/mismatch-in-pathvariable-resolving; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15431180/configure-error-page-for-pathvariable-type-mismatch; https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/25846
