  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'unresolved-queries-and-parameters' checks for unresolved symbols in named and native queries and related API methods. It iterates over all classes and their methods. If a method has either a 'NamedQuery' or 'NativeQuery' annotation, it retrieves the query name from the annotation attribute. If the query name is not empty, it asserts that a call to this query exists. If it does not exist, it reports an 'Unknown named query' error. Furthermore, if the method has parameters, it iterates over these parameters and asserts that each parameter has a corresponding type in the method. If a parameter does not have a corresponding type, it reports an 'Unknown query parameter' error."
