Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/CdiTypedAnnotationInspection.html,The source URL provides information about the @Typed annotation in CDI. It reports violations when the @Typed annotation is used incorrectly. The rules for correct usage are: Only producer methods can have the @Typed annotation and the Bean type must correspond to the types mentioned in the @Typed annotation.,"Rule incorrect-typed-annotation-usage {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (hasAnnotation(c, '@Typed')) {
      assert ( isIterable(getAnnoAttr(c, '@Typed')) AND hasAnnotation(getMethods(c), '@Produces') ) {
        msg(""Incorrect usage of @Typed annotation in class: %s"", getFQN(c));
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'incorrect-typed-annotation-usage' checks all classes in the project. If a class has the @Typed annotation, it asserts that the attribute of the @Typed annotation is iterable (meaning it can be looped over, which is a requirement for @Typed as it can specify multiple types) and that the class has methods annotated with @Produces (meaning they are producer methods). If these conditions are not met, it generates a message indicating the incorrect usage of the @Typed annotation in the class.",,"The rule seems to be correctly checking for the conditions specified in the JetBrains Inspectopedia page. It checks if the @Typed annotation is used correctly, i.e., it is iterable and is used only in producer methods. If these conditions are not met, it generates an error message.","1. https://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/latest/en-US/html/annotations.html: This page from JBoss Weld documentation provides detailed information about CDI annotations including @Typed. It explains how @Typed annotation is used to restrict the set of bean types a bean class or producer method or field has.
2. https://www.baeldung.com/cdi-produces: This page from Baeldung explains the @Produces annotation in CDI. It explains how producer methods are used to create beans for injection and how they can be used with @Typed annotation.",
