  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'incorrect-use-of-find-annotation' checks for each class in the application. For each method in the class, it checks if the method has the @Find annotation. If it does, it asserts that the return type of the method is either an entity type E or one of the specified types. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating the incorrect return type. It also checks for each parameter of the method, asserting that there exists a field in the class with the same name and type as the parameter. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating the mismatch between the parameter and the persistent field."
