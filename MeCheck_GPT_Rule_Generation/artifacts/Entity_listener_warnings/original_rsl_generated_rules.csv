Java Persistence API (JPA),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/JpaEntityListenerWarningsInspection.html,The source URL provides information about a specific inspection in JetBrains that reports entity listener classes that do not have any entity listener methods.,"Rule entity-listener-warnings {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (hasAnnotation(c, ""EntityListener"")) {
      assert ( exists(method m in getMethods(c)) ( hasAnnotation(m, ""PrePersist"") OR hasAnnotation(m, ""PostPersist"") OR hasAnnotation(m, ""PreRemove"") OR hasAnnotation(m, ""PostRemove"") OR hasAnnotation(m, ""PreUpdate"") OR hasAnnotation(m, ""PostUpdate"") OR hasAnnotation(m, ""PostLoad"") ) ) {
        msg(""Entity listener class: %s does not have any entity listener methods"", getFQN(c));
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'entity-listener-warnings' checks all classes in the project. If a class is annotated with 'EntityListener', it asserts that there exists at least one method in the class that is annotated with any of the entity listener methods ('PrePersist', 'PostPersist', 'PreRemove', 'PostRemove', 'PreUpdate', 'PostUpdate', 'PostLoad'). If no such method exists, it reports a warning message indicating that the entity listener class does not have any entity listener methods.",,"The rule is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions and does not introduce any new functions. The rule checks for the existence of entity listener methods in classes annotated with 'EntityListener', which aligns with the requirement of reporting entity listener classes without any entity listener methods.","1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-entity-lifecycle-events Summary: This page provides a comprehensive guide on JPA Entity Lifecycle Events, including the use of Entity Listeners. It explains the different types of entity listener methods, which are checked in the generated rule.
2. URL: https://www.javatpoint.com/jpa-entitylisteners-example Summary: This page provides an example of using JPA EntityListeners. It shows how to define an entity listener class and how to annotate methods with entity listener annotations, which are the focus of the generated rule.",,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31403203/mismatch-in-pathvariable-resolving; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15431180/configure-error-page-for-pathvariable-type-mismatch; https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/25846
