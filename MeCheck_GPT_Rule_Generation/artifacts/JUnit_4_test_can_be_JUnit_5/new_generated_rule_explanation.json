  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'JUnit4_to_JUnit5_conversion' checks all classes in the project. If a class is annotated with 'org.junit.Test', indicating it contains JUnit 4 tests, the rule asserts that there are no methods in the class that are annotated with 'org.junit.runners.Parameterized' or 'org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner', which are custom runners in JUnit 4. If such methods exist, it means that these tests cannot be automatically migrated to JUnit 5 and a message is displayed with the fully qualified name of the class."
