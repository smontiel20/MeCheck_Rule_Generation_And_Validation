Hibernate,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/HibernateConfigDomFacetInspection.html,"The source URL provides information about a JetBrains inspection that checks for missing Hibernate XML configuration files. If such files are missing, the inspection offers a quick-fix that creates a facet if necessary and adds a configuration file to it.","Rule hibernate-config-not-added-to-facet {
  for (file xml in getXMLs()) {
    if (NOT pathExists(xml)) {
      assert (false) {
        msg(""Hibernate configuration XML file: %s is not added to facet"", getName(xml));
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'hibernate-config-not-added-to-facet' checks all XML files in the project. If a Hibernate configuration XML file does not exist in the project, it asserts a failure and generates a message indicating that the Hibernate configuration XML file is not added to the facet.","The built-in functions used in this rule are 'getXMLs', 'pathExists', and 'getName'. No new functions were introduced.","The rule should correctly identify cases where Hibernate configuration XML files are missing from the project. It uses the 'getXMLs' function to retrieve all XML files, 'pathExists' to check if the file exists, and 'getName' to retrieve the name of the file for the error message.","1.
