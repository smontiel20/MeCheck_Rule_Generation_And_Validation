  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'pointcut-method-style' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has the @Pointcut annotation, it asserts that the method's return type is void, it does not have a throws clause, and its body is empty. If these conditions are not met, it generates a message indicating the method and class that violate the rule."
