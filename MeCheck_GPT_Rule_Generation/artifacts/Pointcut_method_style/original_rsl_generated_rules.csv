AOP,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/PointcutMethodStyleInspection.html,"The source URL provides a rule for validating @Pointcut methods in Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). The rule checks that these methods have a void return type, do not have a throws clause, and have an empty method body.","Rule pointcut-method-style {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (hasAnnotation(m, '@Pointcut')) {
        assert (getReturnType(m) == 'void' AND NOT hasParamType(m, 'throws') AND isEmpty(getBody(m))) {

      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'pointcut-method-style' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has the @Pointcut annotation, it asserts that the method's return type is void, it does not have a throws clause, and its body is empty. If these conditions are not met, it generates a message indicating the method and class that violate the rule.",,"The rule 'pointcut-method-style' is syntactically correct according to the Rule-Specific Language (RSL) syntax. It uses the built-in functions: getClasses, getMethods, hasAnnotation, getReturnType, hasParamType, isEmpty, getBody, getName, and getFQN. No new functions were introduced.","1.
