  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'obsolete-junit-assert-method-usage' checks all classes and their methods. If a method's fully qualified name starts with 'junit.framework.Assert', it asserts that there are no calls to this method. If there are, it generates a message indicating that an obsolete junit.framework.Assert method is being called in the class."
