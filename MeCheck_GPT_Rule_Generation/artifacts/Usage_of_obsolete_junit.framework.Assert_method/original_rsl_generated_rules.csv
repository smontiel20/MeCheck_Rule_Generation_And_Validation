Junit,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/UseOfObsoleteAssert.html,The source URL provides information about a rule that reports any calls to methods from the obsolete junit.framework.Assert class. It suggests replacing these calls with methods from the org.junit.Assert class.,"Rule obsolete-junit-assert-method-usage {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (getFQN(m) startsWith 'junit.framework.Assert') {
        assert (NOT callExists(m)) {
          msg('Obsolete junit.framework.Assert method: %s is called in class: %s', getName(m), getFQN(c));
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'obsolete-junit-assert-method-usage' checks all classes and their methods. If a method's fully qualified name starts with 'junit.framework.Assert', it asserts that there are no calls to this method. If there are, it generates a message indicating that an obsolete junit.framework.Assert method is being called in the class.",,The rule is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions and does not introduce any new ones. It checks for the usage of obsolete junit.framework.Assert methods in all classes and generates a message if any are found.,"1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/junit-assertions Summary: This page provides a comprehensive guide to JUnit assertions, including the difference between JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 assertions.
