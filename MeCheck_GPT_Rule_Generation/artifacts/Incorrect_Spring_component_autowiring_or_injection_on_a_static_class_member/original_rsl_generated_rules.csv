}","The rule 'incorrect_static_member_autowiring' checks all classes in the project. If a class is annotated as a Spring Component, it checks all fields and methods of the class. If a field or method is annotated with 'Autowired' or 'Inject', it asserts that the field or method is not static. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that the static field or method should not be autowired or injected.",,"The generated rule seems to be logically correct and follows the syntax of RSL. It uses only the built-in functions and does not introduce any new ones. The rule checks for the incorrect usage of autowiring or injection on static members in Spring components, which aligns with the topic and content provided.","1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-inject-static-field
Summary: This article from Baeldung explains why it's not recommended to autowire static fields in Spring. It provides an example of how to do it, but also explains the problems associated with it, such as the inability to manage the lifecycle of the static field.

2. URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7026507/why-are-spring-private-fields-injected
Summary: This StackOverflow thread discusses why private fields are injected in Spring and the problems associated with injecting static fields. The consensus is that static fields should not be injected as it goes against the principles of dependency injection.",
