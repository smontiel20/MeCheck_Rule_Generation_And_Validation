Java Persistence API (JPA),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/ConverterNotAnnotatedInspection.html,The source URL provides a rule that checks for the presence of @Converter annotation on JPA converter.,"Rule JPA_Converter_Annotation_Check {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (getName(c).endsWith('Converter')) {
      assert ( hasAnnotation(c, '@Converter') ) {
        msg(""Class: %s is a JPA converter but is not annotated with @Converter"", getFQN(c));
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'JPA_Converter_Annotation_Check' checks all classes in the project. If the class name ends with 'Converter', it asserts that the class should be annotated with '@Converter'. If the class is not annotated with '@Converter', it generates a message indicating that the class is a JPA converter but is not annotated with '@Converter'.","The built-in functions used in this rule are 'getClasses', 'getName', 'endsWith', 'hasAnnotation', and 'getFQN'. No new functions were introduced.",,"1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-attribute-converters
