Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/CdiSpecializesInspection.html,"The source URL provides information about the incorrect usage of the @Specializes annotation in the CDI framework. It highlights that a specializing bean must extend another bean, a specializing method must override a @Produces method of its direct superclass, the @Named annotation cannot be used on the specializing and specialized class, two or more classes cannot specialize the same superclass, and a specializing method cannot be static.","Rule incorrect-specializes-usage {

}","The rule 'incorrect-specializes-usage' checks for classes in the application that have the @Specializes annotation. For each such class, it asserts that there is a unique superclass that it specializes, and that the class does not have the @Named annotation. For each method in the class that has the @Specializes annotation, it asserts that there is a method in the superclass that it overrides which has the @Produces annotation, and that the method is not static. If any of these assertions fail, an appropriate error message is generated.",,,"1. https://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0/cdi-spec.html#specializes - This is the official specification for the @Specializes annotation in the CDI framework. It provides detailed information about the correct usage of the annotation, which aligns with the rule generated.
2. https://www.baeldung.com/cdi-specializes - This article provides a practical guide to using the @Specializes annotation in CDI, including examples of incorrect usage that would be caught by the generated rule.",
