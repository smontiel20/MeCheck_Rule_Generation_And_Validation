JUnit,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/JUnit3StyleTestMethodInJUnit4Class.html,The source URL describes a rule that identifies JUnit 3 style test methods that are located inside a class that does not extend the JUnit 3 TestCase class but contains JUnit 4 or JUnit 5 @Test annotated methods. These test methods cannot be run.,"Rule old_style_junit_test_method_in_junit4_class {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (NOT hasAnnotation(c, 'org.junit.Test')) {
      for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
        if (startsWith(getName(m), 'test') AND NOT hasAnnotation(m, 'org.junit.Test')) {
          assert (getSuperclass(c) == 'junit.framework.TestCase') {
            msg('JUnit 3 style test method: %s in JUnit 4 class: %s cannot be run', getName(m), getFQN(c));
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'old_style_junit_test_method_in_junit4_class' checks all classes in the project. If a class does not have the JUnit 4 or JUnit 5 @Test annotation, it checks all methods in the class. If a method starts with 'test' and does not have the @Test annotation, it asserts that the superclass of the class is 'junit.framework.TestCase'. If the superclass is not 'junit.framework.TestCase', it generates a message indicating that the JUnit 3 style test method in the JUnit 4 class cannot be run.","The built-in functions used in this rule are: getClasses, hasAnnotation, getMethods, startsWith, getName, assert, getSuperclass, getFQN, and msg. No new functions were introduced.",,"1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/junit-5-migration
Summary: This page provides a guide on migrating from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5. It mentions that JUnit 3 style test methods that start with 'test' and are located in a class that does not extend the JUnit 3 TestCase class but contains JUnit 4 or JUnit 5 @Test annotated methods cannot be run.

Summary: This page discusses the new annotations in JUnit 4 and how they differ from JUnit 3. It also mentions that JUnit 3 style test methods in a JUnit 4 class cannot be run unless the class extends 'junit.framework.TestCase'.",
