  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'missing-aspectj-autoproxy' checks all XML files in the project. If an XML file does not contain the <aop:aspectj-autoproxy/> element, the rule then checks all classes. If a class has the @Aspect annotation, the rule asserts that the Spring version is 2.5 or later. If the Spring version is earlier than 2.5, a message is generated indicating that the @Aspect annotation was found in a class without the <aop:aspectj-autoproxy/> element in the XML configuration."
