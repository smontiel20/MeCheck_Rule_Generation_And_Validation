Spring MVC,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/SpringMVCViewInspection.html,The source URL provides information about a rule in JetBrains Inspectopedia that reports unresolved Spring MVC View references.,"Rule unresolved-view-reference {

}","This rule checks for unresolved view references in Spring MVC. It iterates over all XML files and checks if they contain '<mvc:view>' or '<mvc:view-resolver>' elements. For each '<mvc:view>' element, it retrieves the 'name' attribute and checks if it is not empty. If the 'name' attribute is not empty, it asserts that a call to this view exists or it is a library class. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating the unresolved view reference.",,"The rule syntax is correct according to the RSL syntax. The rule uses only the built-in functions and does not introduce any new functions. The rule checks for unresolved view references in Spring MVC, which is the intended purpose of the rule.","1.
