Spring Core,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/SpringCacheNamesInspection.html,"The source URL provides information about a rule that checks for incorrect @Cache* annotation names in Spring bean components. It specifies that at least one cache name should be provided per cache operation: @Cacheable(""cache_name"") or @Cacheable(cacheNames =""cache_name""). It also mentions that @CacheConfig#cacheNames() can be used for sharing common cache-related settings at the class level.","Rule incorrect-autowiring-in-spring-bean-components {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (hasAnnotation(c, ""@Cacheable"") OR hasAnnotation(c, ""@CacheConfig"")) {
      String[] cacheNames = getAnnoAttrNames(c);
      assert (NOT isEmpty(cacheNames)) {
        msg(""Incorrect @Cache* annotation names in class: %s. At least one cache name should be provided per cache operation."", getFQN(c));
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'incorrect-autowiring-in-spring-bean-components' checks all classes in the application. If a class has either the @Cacheable or @CacheConfig annotation, it retrieves the names of the cache attributes. It then asserts that the cache names are not empty. If the cache names are empty, it generates a message indicating that the @Cache* annotation names in the class are incorrect and that at least one cache name should be provided per cache operation.","The rule uses the following built-in functions: getClasses, hasAnnotation, getAnnoAttrNames, NOT, isEmpty, msg, getFQN. No new functions were introduced.",,"1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cache-tutorial
Summary: This tutorial on Baeldung explains how to use Spring's caching annotations, including @Cacheable and @CacheConfig. It provides examples of how to correctly use these annotations, which can help in understanding the rule.

2. URL: https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-caching
Summary: JavaTPoint provides a comprehensive guide on Spring Caching, including the use of @Cacheable and @CacheConfig annotations. It also explains how to provide cache names, which is directly related to the rule.",
