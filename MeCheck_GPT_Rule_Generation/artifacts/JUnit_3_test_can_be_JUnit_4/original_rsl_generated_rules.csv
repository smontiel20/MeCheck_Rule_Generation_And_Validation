JUnit,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/Junit4Converter.html,The source URL provides information about a JetBrains tool that identifies JUnit 3 test classes that can be converted to JUnit 4 test classes. It also provides an example of how the tool works after the quick-fix is applied.,"Rule JUnit3_to_JUnit4_conversion {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (getAnnoAttr(c, 'Test') == 'junit.framework') {
      assert (classExists(getFQN(c) + 'Test')) {
        msg('JUnit 3 test class: %s can be converted to JUnit 4', getFQN(c));
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'JUnit3_to_JUnit4_conversion' checks all classes in the project. If a class has an annotation attribute 'Test' from the 'junit.framework' package, it asserts that a corresponding JUnit 4 test class exists. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that the JUnit 3 test class can be converted to JUnit 4.",,The rule is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions and does not introduce any new ones. The rule checks for the existence of a JUnit 4 test class for each JUnit 3 test class in the project.,"1.
