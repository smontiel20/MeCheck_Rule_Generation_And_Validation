  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'lombok_all_args_no_default_constructor' checks all classes in the project. If a class has the @AllArgsConstructor annotation, the rule asserts that there exists a method in the class which is a constructor (name is '<init>') and does not have any parameters (hasParam(m, 0) is true). If such a method does not exist, it means the class uses @AllArgsConstructor but does not define a no-argument constructor, which breaks the JPA specification. In such a case, a message is displayed with the fully qualified name of the class."
