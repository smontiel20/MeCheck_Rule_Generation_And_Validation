Java Persistence API (JPA),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/LombokAllArgsInspection.html,The source URL provides information about a JetBrains inspection that checks if the @lombok.AllArgsConstructor annotation is used in JPA entities. The inspection warns that using this annotation without defining a no-argument constructor can break the JPA specification.,"Rule lombok_all_args_no_default_constructor {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (hasAnnotation(c, '@AllArgsConstructor')) {
      assert ( exists(method m in getMethods(c)) ( getName(m) == '<init>' AND hasParam(m, 0) ) ) {
        msg(""Class: %s uses @AllArgsConstructor but does not define a no-argument constructor, which breaks JPA specification"", getFQN(c));
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'lombok_all_args_no_default_constructor' checks all classes in the project. If a class has the @AllArgsConstructor annotation, the rule asserts that there exists a method in the class which is a constructor (name is '<init>') and does not have any parameters (hasParam(m, 0) is true). If such a method does not exist, it means the class uses @AllArgsConstructor but does not define a no-argument constructor, which breaks the JPA specification. In such a case, a message is displayed with the fully qualified name of the class.",,"The rule is syntactically correct and uses only the built-in functions. It checks for the existence of a no-argument constructor in classes annotated with @AllArgsConstructor, which aligns with the topic and content provided.","1. https://www.baeldung.com/lombok-annotations: This page provides a comprehensive guide to Lombok annotations, including @AllArgsConstructor. It explains that @AllArgsConstructor generates a constructor with one parameter for each field in the class, which can cause issues with JPA entities if a no-argument constructor is not defined.
2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2948083/why-does-jpa-have-a-no-arg-constructor-requirement: This StackOverflow thread discusses why JPA requires a no-argument constructor, providing context for why the rule generated is important for JPA entities.",
