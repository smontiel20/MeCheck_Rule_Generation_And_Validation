Java-TestNG,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/ExpectedExceptionNeverThrownTestNG.html,The source URL provides information about a specific issue in TestNG test methods where checked exceptions that are expected are not actually thrown within the method body.,"Rule expected-exception-never-thrown {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (hasAnnotation(m, 'Test')) {
        String expectedException = getAnnoAttr(m, 'expectedExceptions');

}","The rule 'expected-exception-never-thrown' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has a 'Test' annotation and it expects an exception (as indicated by the 'expectedExceptions' attribute), the rule asserts that there is a statement in the method body that throws the expected exception. If the expected exception is not thrown, a message is generated indicating the expected exception, the test method name, and the fully qualified name of the class.",,"The rule is syntactically correct and uses only the built-in functions. It follows the RSL syntax and uses the functions getClasses, getMethods, hasAnnotation, getAnnoAttr, isEmpty, exists, contains, getName, and getFQN. The rule checks for the existence of a throw statement for the expected exception in the method body.","1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/testng-expected-exceptions
Summary: This page provides a detailed explanation of how to use the 'expectedExceptions' attribute in TestNG to specify that a test method is expected to throw certain exceptions. It also explains how TestNG handles the situation when the expected exception is not thrown.
