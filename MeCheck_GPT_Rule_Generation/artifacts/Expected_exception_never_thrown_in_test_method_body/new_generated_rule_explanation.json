  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'expected-exception-never-thrown' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has a 'Test' annotation and it expects an exception (as indicated by the 'expectedExceptions' attribute), the rule asserts that there is a statement in the method body that throws the expected exception. If the expected exception is not thrown, a message is generated indicating the expected exception, the test method name, and the fully qualified name of the class."
