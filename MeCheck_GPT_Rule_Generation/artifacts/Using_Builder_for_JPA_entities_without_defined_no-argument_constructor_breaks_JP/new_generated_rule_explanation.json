  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'lombok-builder-no-arg-constructor' checks all classes in the project. If a class has the @Builder annotation, it asserts that there exists a method in the class which is a constructor (name is '<init>') and has no parameters (parameter type is '()V'). If such a method does not exist, it raises an error message stating that the class uses @Builder but does not have a no-argument constructor."
