Spring Core,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/SpringCacheableMethodCallsInspection.html,"The content discusses the use of @Cacheable annotation in Spring Core. It explains that in proxy mode, only external method calls coming through the proxy are intercepted. Therefore, self-invocation, i.e., a method within the target object calling another method of the target object, will not lead to actual caching at runtime even if the invoked method is marked with @Cacheable.","Rule cacheable_self_invocation {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (hasAnnotation(m, '@Cacheable')) {
        for (method innerM in getMethods(c)) {
          if (callExists(m, innerM)) {
            assert (NOT isUniqueSN(innerM)) {
              msg(""Method: %s in class: %s is a self-invocation and will not lead to actual caching even though it's marked with @Cacheable"", getName(innerM), getFQN(c));
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'cacheable_self_invocation' checks all classes and their methods in the application. If a method is annotated with @Cacheable, it checks for any calls within that method to other methods in the same class (self-invocation). If such a call exists, it asserts that the invoked method is not unique. If the assertion fails, it means that the self-invocation will not lead to actual caching at runtime even though it's marked with @Cacheable, and a message is displayed with the method and class names.",,,"1.

Summary: This article on Baeldung explains the issue of self-invocation in Spring caching. It confirms that self-invocations do not trigger the cache aspect, which aligns with the rule generated.

Summary: This StackOverflow thread discusses a problem where a @Cacheable method is ignored when called from within the same class, which is the issue our rule is designed to detect.",
