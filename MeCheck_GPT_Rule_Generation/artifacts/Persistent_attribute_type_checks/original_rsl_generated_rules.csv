Java Persistence API (JPA),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/JpaAttributeTypeInspection.html,The source page describes a rule that checks for type mismatches in JPA attributes. It reports when the type of a persistent attribute does not match the expected type.,"Rule persistent-attribute-type-checks {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (field f in getFields(c)) {
      if (hasAnnotation(f, ""@javax.persistence.Column"")) {
        String expectedType = getAnnoAttr(f, ""columnDefinition"");
        if (NOT isEmpty(expectedType)) {
          assert (getType(f) == expectedType) {
            msg(""Persistent attribute: %s in class: %s has a type mismatch. Expected: %s, Found: %s"",
                getName(f), getFQN(c), expectedType, getType(f));
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'persistent-attribute-type-checks' checks all classes and their fields. If a field has the '@javax.persistence.Column' annotation, it retrieves the expected type from the 'columnDefinition' attribute of the annotation. If the expected type is not empty, it asserts that the actual type of the field matches the expected type. If there is a mismatch, it reports an error message with the field name, class name, expected type, and actual type.",,"The rule uses only the built-in functions provided in the prompt. It does not introduce any new functions. It follows the syntax of RSL and does not contain any comments or BOM. The rule checks for type mismatches in JPA attributes, which is the topic provided in the prompt.","1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-entity-attribute-type-mismatch
