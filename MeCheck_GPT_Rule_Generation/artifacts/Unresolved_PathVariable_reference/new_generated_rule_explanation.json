  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'unresolved-path-variable-reference' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has the '@PathVariable' annotation, it retrieves the value of the path variable. If the path variable is not empty, it asserts that the URL, obtained from the 'RequestMapping' attribute of the method, contains the path variable. If the URL does not contain the path variable, it generates a message indicating the unresolved @PathVariable reference, specifying the path variable, the method, and the class."
