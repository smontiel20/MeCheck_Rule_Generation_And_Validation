  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'invalid-data-provider-return-type' checks all classes and their methods. If a method is marked with the @DataProvider annotation, it checks the return type of the method. The rule asserts that the return type should be either 'Object[][]' or 'Iterator<Object>'. If the return type is anything else, it generates a message indicating the method and class where the issue was found."
