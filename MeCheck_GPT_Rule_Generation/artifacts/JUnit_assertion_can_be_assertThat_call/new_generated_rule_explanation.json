  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'migrateAssertToMatcherAssert' checks all classes and their methods. If a method contains calls to 'Assert.assertEquals' or 'Assert.assertTrue', it asserts that the same method does not contain a call to 'Assert.assertThat'. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that the method can be migrated to use 'Assert.assertThat' in Hamcrest declarative style."
