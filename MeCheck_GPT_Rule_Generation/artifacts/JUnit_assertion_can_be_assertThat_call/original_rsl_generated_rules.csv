JUnit,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/MigrateAssertToMatcherAssert.html,"The source page describes a rule that identifies calls to Assert.assertEquals(), Assert.assertTrue(), and similar methods that can be migrated to the Hamcrest declarative style Assert.assertThat() calls. It also provides a quick-fix to perform this migration.","Rule migrateAssertToMatcherAssert {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (callExists(m, 'Assert.assertEquals') OR callExists(m, 'Assert.assertTrue')) {

        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'migrateAssertToMatcherAssert' checks all classes and their methods. If a method contains calls to 'Assert.assertEquals' or 'Assert.assertTrue', it asserts that the same method does not contain a call to 'Assert.assertThat'. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that the method can be migrated to use 'Assert.assertThat' in Hamcrest declarative style.",,"The rule uses built-in functions such as 'getClasses', 'getMethods', 'callExists', 'getName', and 'getFQN'. It does not introduce any new built-in functions. The rule follows the syntax of RSL and does not contain any comments or BOM.","1.
