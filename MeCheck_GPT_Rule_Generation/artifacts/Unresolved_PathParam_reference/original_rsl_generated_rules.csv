}","The rule 'unresolved-path-param-reference' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has the '@PathParam' annotation, it retrieves the value of the '@PathParam'. If the '@PathParam' is not empty, it asserts that the '@PathParam' exists in the Fully Qualified Name (FQN) of the class (which represents the URL path). If the '@PathParam' is not found in the URL path, it generates a message indicating the '@PathParam', the method, and the class where the issue was found.",,,"1. https://www.baeldung.com/jax-rs-path-param: This page provides a comprehensive guide on how to use @PathParam in JAX-RS. It explains how to declare @PathParam in method signatures and how to include them in the URL path.
