  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'unresolved-path-param-reference' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has the '@PathParam' annotation, it retrieves the value of the '@PathParam'. If the '@PathParam' is not empty, it asserts that the '@PathParam' exists in the Fully Qualified Name (FQN) of the class (which represents the URL path). If the '@PathParam' is not found in the URL path, it generates a message indicating the '@PathParam', the method, and the class where the issue was found."
