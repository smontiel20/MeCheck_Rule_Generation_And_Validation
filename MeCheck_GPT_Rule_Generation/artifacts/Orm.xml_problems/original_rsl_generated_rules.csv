Java Persistence API (JPA),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/JpaORMDomInspection.html,"The source URL provides information about a JetBrains Inspectopedia rule that reports unresolved references to any database objects inside `orm.xml` configuration files. These database objects include Tables, Columns, Schemas, Catalogs, and Sequences.","Rule unresolved-db-refs-in-orm { for (file orm in getXMLs()) { if (elementExists(orm, ""<entity>"") OR elementExists(orm, ""<table>"")) { for (<entity> entity in getElms(orm, ""<entity>"")) { String entityTable = getAttr(entity, ""table""); if (NOT isEmpty(entityTable)) { assert ( classExists(entityTable) OR isLibraryClass(entityTable) ) { msg(""Entity table: %s mentioned in entity: %s, does not exist"", entityTable, getName(entity)); } } } for (<table> table in getElms(orm, ""<table>"")) { String tableName = getAttr(table, ""name""); if (NOT isEmpty(tableName)) { assert ( classExists(tableName) OR isLibraryClass(tableName) ) { msg(""Table name: %s mentioned in table: %s, does not exist"", tableName, getName(table)); } } } } } }","The rule 'unresolved-db-refs-in-orm' checks for unresolved references to any database objects inside `orm.xml` configuration files. It iterates over all XML files and checks if there are any elements named 'entity' or 'table'. If such elements exist, it retrieves their 'table' or 'name' attribute respectively and checks if a class with that name exists or if it is a library class. If neither is the case, it asserts an error message indicating that the referenced table or entity does not exist.",,"The generated rule is syntactically correct and follows the Rule-Specific Language (RSL) syntax. It uses only the built-in functions provided, such as 'getXMLs', 'elementExists', 'getElms', 'getAttr', 'isEmpty', 'classExists', 'isLibraryClass', and 'msg'. The rule logic is sound and should correctly identify unresolved references to database objects in `orm.xml` files.","1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-entities - This page provides a comprehensive guide to JPA Entities, which are a core concept in the Java Persistence API. It explains how to define and configure entities, which is relevant to the rule as it checks for unresolved references to entities in `orm.xml` files. 2. URL: https://www.objectdb.com/java/jpa/persistence/overview - This page provides an overview of the Java Persistence API (JPA) and its various components. It explains the role of `orm.xml` files in configuring the persistence layer, which is directly related to the rule's purpose of checking for unresolved references in these files.",,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31403203/mismatch-in-pathvariable-resolving; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15431180/configure-error-page-for-pathvariable-type-mismatch; https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/25846
