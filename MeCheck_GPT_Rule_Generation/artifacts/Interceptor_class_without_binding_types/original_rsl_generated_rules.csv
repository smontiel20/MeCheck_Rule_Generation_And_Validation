CDI,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/CdiInterceptorInspection.html,"The source URL provides information about a specific inspection in the CDI framework. It reports @Interceptor classes that do not specify at least one interceptor binding type, which is a requirement for proper functioning.","Rule interceptor_without_binding_type {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (hasAnnotation(c, '@Interceptor')) {
      assert ( exists(String bindingType in getAnnoAttrNames(c, '@Interceptor')) ( NOT isEmpty(bindingType) ) ) {
        msg(""@Interceptor class: %s does not specify any binding type"", getFQN(c));
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'interceptor_without_binding_type' checks all classes in the project. If a class has the '@Interceptor' annotation, it asserts that there exists at least one binding type specified in the '@Interceptor' annotation. If no binding type is found, it generates a message indicating that the '@Interceptor' class does not specify any binding type.",,"The rule is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions provided, such as 'getClasses', 'hasAnnotation', 'exists', 'getAnnoAttrNames', 'NOT', 'isEmpty', and 'getFQN'. The rule logic is sound as it checks for the existence of at least one binding type in '@Interceptor' annotated classes.","1.
