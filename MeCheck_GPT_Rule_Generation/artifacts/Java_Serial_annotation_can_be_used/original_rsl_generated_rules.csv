Java-Serialization Issues,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/MissingSerialAnnotation.html,The source URL provides information about the '@Serial' annotation in Java. It explains that this annotation should be used for methods and fields in Serializable and Externalizable classes. The JetBrains tool provides a quick-fix that adds this annotation where it's missing. The page refers to the Javadoc of the java.io.Serial class for more detailed information.,"Rule missing-serial-annotation {

}","The rule 'missing-serial-annotation' checks all classes in the project. For each class, it checks if it has methods or fields. If it does, it iterates over each method and field. If a method or field does not have the '@Serial' annotation, it asserts that the return type of the method or the type of the field is either 'Serializable' or 'Externalizable'. If this assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that the method or field should be annotated with '@Serial'.",,"The generated rule is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions and does not introduce any new ones. The rule checks for the '@Serial' annotation in methods and fields of 'Serializable' and 'Externalizable' classes, which aligns with the topic and content provided.","1.

Summary: This page provides a comprehensive guide to Java Serialization, including a section on the '@Serial' annotation. It explains when and why to use this annotation, which aligns with the generated rule.

2. URL: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/io/Serial.html
Summary: This is the official Javadoc for the java.io.Serial interface. It provides detailed information about the '@Serial' annotation, including its usage in Serializable and Externalizable classes.",
