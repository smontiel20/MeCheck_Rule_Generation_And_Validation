  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'missing-serial-annotation' checks all classes in the project. For each class, it checks if it has methods or fields. If it does, it iterates over each method and field. If a method or field does not have the '@Serial' annotation, it asserts that the return type of the method or the type of the field is either 'Serializable' or 'Externalizable'. If this assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that the method or field should be annotated with '@Serial'."
