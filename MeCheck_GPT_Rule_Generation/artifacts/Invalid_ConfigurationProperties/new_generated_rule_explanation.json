  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'invalid-configuration-properties' checks all classes in the application. If a class is annotated with @ConfigurationProperties and is not registered via @EnableConfigurationProperties or does not have any other annotations, it retrieves the 'prefix' attribute from the @ConfigurationProperties annotation. It then asserts that the prefix is not empty, is unique, and starts with a hyphen (indicating kebab-case). If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating the invalid prefix and the fully qualified name of the class."
