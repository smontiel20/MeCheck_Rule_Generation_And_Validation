}","The rule 'invalid-context-configuration' checks each class in the project. If a class has the @ContextConfiguration annotation, it retrieves the 'locations' attribute of the annotation, which should contain paths to context configuration files. For each location, it asserts that the path exists. If the path does not exist, it reports an error message. Furthermore, it checks if the default application context file 'applicationContext.xml' exists. If it does not exist, it reports an error message.",,The rule 'invalid-context-configuration' is syntactically correct and uses only the built-in functions. It follows the syntax of RSL and does not introduce any new built-in functions.,"1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-contextconfiguration
Summary: This page provides a comprehensive guide on using @ContextConfiguration in Spring. It explains how to specify context configuration locations and how to use the default context configuration file.

2. URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42822875/springboot-contextconfiguration-locations-file-not-found
Summary: This StackOverflow thread discusses a problem where the @ContextConfiguration annotation cannot find the specified context configuration file. The answers suggest checking the file path and making sure the file exists.",
