  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'invalid-context-configuration' checks each class in the project. If a class has the @ContextConfiguration annotation, it retrieves the 'locations' attribute of the annotation, which should contain paths to context configuration files. For each location, it asserts that the path exists. If the path does not exist, it reports an error message. Furthermore, it checks if the default application context file 'applicationContext.xml' exists. If it does not exist, it reports an error message."
