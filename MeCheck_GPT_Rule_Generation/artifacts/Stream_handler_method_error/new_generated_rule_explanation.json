  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'stream-handler-method-error' checks for inconsistency errors in stream handler methods in all classes. It checks if a method is annotated with @StreamListener or @StreamEmitter. If so, it retrieves the value of the 'value' attribute of the @StreamListener annotation. It then checks if this value is not empty and if the method has parameters annotated with @Input or @Output. If both conditions are true, it asserts false and reports an error message. The rule also checks if a method is annotated with @StreamListener and if the channel is empty. If so, it asserts false and reports an error message. The rule checks if the method can return a value and if the channel is empty. If so, it asserts false and reports an error message. The rule checks if the method cannot return a value and if the channel is not empty. If so, it asserts false and reports an error message. Finally, the rule checks if the method has a 'condition' attribute in the @StreamListener annotation and if the method can return a value. If both conditions are true, it asserts false and reports an error message."
