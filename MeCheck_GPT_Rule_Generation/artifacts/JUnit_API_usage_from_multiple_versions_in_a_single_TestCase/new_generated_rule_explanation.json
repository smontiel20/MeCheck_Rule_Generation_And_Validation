  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'JUnitMixedFramework' checks all classes in the project. If a class has a 'Test' annotation, it retrieves the superclass of the class and the version of the JUnit framework used in the current class and the superclass. If there is no superclass, it uses the version of the current class. It then asserts that the version of the JUnit framework used in the current class is the same as the one used in the superclass. If they are different, it generates a message indicating that the JUnit annotated method in the current class is from a different JUnit version than its superclass."
