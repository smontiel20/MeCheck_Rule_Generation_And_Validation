If it finds any, it asserts that the comment should not contain the <code> tag and suggests replacing it with the {@code ...} construct. The rule uses the built-in functions getFiles(), getClasses(), getMethods(), getComment(), contains(), getName(), and getFQN().",,The rule 'replace_code_with_javadoc_tag' is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions and does not introduce any new functions. The rule checks for the usage of <code> tags in Javadoc comments and suggests replacing them with {@code ...} constructs.,"1.
