  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'invalid-spring-boot-setup' checks all classes in the application. If a class has the @SpringBootApplication annotation, it checks if the fully qualified name (FQN) of the class is the same as the class name, which indicates that the class is in the default package. If so, it reports a message. It also checks if the class has either @EnableAutoConfiguration or @ComponentScan annotations, which are redundant when @SpringBootApplication is present. If either of these annotations is found, it reports a message."
