  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'invalid-package-in-componentscan' checks all classes in the application. If a class has the @ComponentScan annotation, it retrieves the 'basePackages' attribute of the annotation which should contain the packages to scan. For each package in the 'basePackages', it asserts that the package exists as a class or is a library class. If the package does not exist, it generates a message indicating the package and the class with the @ComponentScan annotation."
