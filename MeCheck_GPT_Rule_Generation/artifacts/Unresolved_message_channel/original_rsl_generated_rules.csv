Spring Cloud Stream,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/SpringCloudStreamMessageChannelInspection.html,"The source URL provides information about a common issue in Spring Cloud Stream where unresolved channel attributes in @StreamListener, @SendTo, @Output, and @Input annotations can lead to a 'bean not found' error at runtime.","Rule unresolved-message-channel {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (hasAnnotation(c, '@StreamListener') OR hasAnnotation(c, '@SendTo') OR hasAnnotation(c, '@Output') OR hasAnnotation(c, '@Input')) {
      String channelName = getAnnoAttr(c, 'value');
      if (NOT isEmpty(channelName)) {
        assert ( exists(⟨bean⟩ b in getFamily(c)) ( getName(b) == channelName ) ) {
          msg(""Unresolved message channel: %s in class: %s"", channelName, getFQN(c));
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'unresolved-message-channel' checks all classes in the project. If a class has any of the annotations '@StreamListener', '@SendTo', '@Output', or '@Input', it retrieves the value of the annotation which is expected to be the name of the message channel. If the channel name is not empty, it asserts that there exists a bean in the same family (i.e., in the same context or configuration) as the class, whose name matches the channel name. If such a bean does not exist, it reports an error message indicating the unresolved message channel and the class where it is found.","The rule uses the following built-in functions: getClasses, hasAnnotation, getAnnoAttr, isEmpty, exists, getFamily, getName, getFQN, and msg. No new functions were introduced.",,"1. URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40969821/spring-cloud-stream-unknown-channel-name
Summary: This StackOverflow thread discusses a similar issue where a user is getting an 'unknown channel name' error in Spring Cloud Stream. The responses suggest checking the configuration and ensuring that the channel names are correctly defined and resolved.

2. URL: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/issues/1167
Summary: This GitHub issue in the Spring Cloud Stream repository reports a 'bean not found' error due to an unresolved message channel. The discussion suggests that the issue might be due to incorrect or missing configuration.",
