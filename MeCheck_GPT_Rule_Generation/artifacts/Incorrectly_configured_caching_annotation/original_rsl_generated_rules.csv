Spring Core,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/SpringCacheableComponentsInspection.html,"The source URL provides information about the JetBrains Inspectopedia rule that checks for incorrectly configured 'caching' annotations in Spring Core such as @Cacheable, @CacheEvict, @CachePut, @CacheConfig, etc.","Rule incorrectly-configured-caching-annotation {

}","The rule 'incorrectly-configured-caching-annotation' checks all classes in the project. If a class has any of the caching annotations (@Cacheable, @CacheEvict, @CachePut, @CacheConfig), it retrieves the names of all attributes of these annotations. For each attribute, it asserts that the attribute is correctly configured. If not, it generates a message indicating the incorrectly configured caching annotation and the class where it is found.",,,"1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cache-tutorial
Summary: This tutorial on Baeldung explains how to use Spring's caching annotations, including @Cacheable, @CacheEvict, @CachePut, and @CacheConfig. It provides examples of correct usage, which can be contrasted with incorrect configurations that the generated rule would catch.

2. URL: https://www.javadevjournal.com/spring-boot/spring-boot-caching/
Summary: This Java Dev Journal article provides a comprehensive guide to caching in Spring Boot, including the use of annotations like @Cacheable, @CacheEvict, @CachePut, and @CacheConfig. It also discusses common mistakes and how to avoid them, which is relevant to the rule's purpose of detecting incorrectly configured caching annotations.",
