Spring Core,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/SpringScheduledMethodsInspection.html,The source page describes a rule that checks for incorrect bean references in the scheduler parameter of the @Scheduled annotation in Spring Core.,"Rule incorrectly_referenced_bean_in_scheduled {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (hasAnnotation(c, '@Scheduled')) {
      String schedulerBean = getAnnoAttr(c, '@Scheduled', 'scheduler');
      if (NOT isEmpty(schedulerBean)) {
        assert ( classExists(schedulerBean) OR isLibraryClass(schedulerBean) ) {
          msg(""Incorrectly referenced bean: %s in @Scheduled annotation in class: %s"", schedulerBean, getFQN(c));
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'incorrectly_referenced_bean_in_scheduled' checks all classes in the project. If a class has the @Scheduled annotation, it retrieves the 'scheduler' attribute of the annotation, which should be a bean reference. If the scheduler bean is not empty, it asserts that the class of the bean exists or it is a library class. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating the incorrectly referenced bean in the @Scheduled annotation.",,,"https://www.baeldung.com/spring-scheduled-tasks: This page from Baeldung provides a comprehensive guide on how to use @Scheduled annotation in Spring. It explains how to configure and use the 'scheduler' attribute in the annotation, which is relevant to the rule.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26116703/spring-scheduled-fixeddelay-string-value-from-properties-doesnt-work: This StackOverflow thread discusses issues related to the 'scheduler' attribute in the @Scheduled annotation, including incorrect bean references, which is the focus of the rule.",
