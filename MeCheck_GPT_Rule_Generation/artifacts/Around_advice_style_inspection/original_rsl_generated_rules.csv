AOP,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/AroundAdviceStyleInspection.html,"The page describes a rule for using @Around advice in Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). It states that the method annotated with @Around must call org.aspectj.lang.ProceedingJoinPoint#proceed and return its result. The method must have ProceedingJoinPoint as the first argument and Object as the return type. If these conditions are not met, it is likely a coding error.","Rule around_advice_style_inspection {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (hasAnnotation(m, '@Around')) {
        assert (getArg(m, 0) == 'ProceedingJoinPoint' AND getReturnType(m) == 'Object') {
          msg('Method: %s in class: %s does not follow @Around advice style. It should have ProceedingJoinPoint as the first argument and Object as the return type.', getName(m), getFQN(c));
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'around_advice_style_inspection' checks all classes and their methods. If a method is annotated with '@Around', it asserts that the first argument of the method is 'ProceedingJoinPoint' and the return type is 'Object'. If these conditions are not met, it generates a message indicating the method and class that do not follow the @Around advice style.",,,"1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-aop-advice-tutorial
