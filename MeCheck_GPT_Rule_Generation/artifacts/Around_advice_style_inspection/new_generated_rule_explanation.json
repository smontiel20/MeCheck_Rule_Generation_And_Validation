  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'around_advice_style_inspection' checks all classes and their methods. If a method is annotated with '@Around', it asserts that the first argument of the method is 'ProceedingJoinPoint' and the return type is 'Object'. If these conditions are not met, it generates a message indicating the method and class that do not follow the @Around advice style."
