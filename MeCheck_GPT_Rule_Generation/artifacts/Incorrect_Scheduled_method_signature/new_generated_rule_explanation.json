  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'incorrect-scheduled-method-signature' checks all classes and their methods in the application. If a method is annotated with @Scheduled, it asserts that the return type of the method is void and the method does not have any parameters. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating the method and class where the incorrect signature is found."
