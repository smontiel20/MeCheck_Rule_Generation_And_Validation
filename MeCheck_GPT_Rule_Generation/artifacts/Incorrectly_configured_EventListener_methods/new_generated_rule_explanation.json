  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'incorrectly-configured-eventlistener-methods' checks all classes and their methods in a Spring application. If a method is annotated with @EventListener, the rule asserts that the return type of the method is void and it either has no arguments or only one argument. If these conditions are not met, the rule generates a message indicating that the method is incorrectly configured as an @EventListener method."
