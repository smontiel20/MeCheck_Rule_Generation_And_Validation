JUnit,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/Junit4RunWithInspection.html,The source URL provides information about a potential issue in JUnit testing where both parent and child classes in a test hierarchy are annotated with @RunWith. This can lead to unexpected testing behavior.,"Rule runWithAnnotationExistsInParent {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (hasAnnotation(c, '@RunWith')) {
      for (class p in getFamily(c)) {
        if (hasAnnotation(p, '@RunWith')) {
          assert (NOT hasAnnotation(p, '@RunWith')) {

}","The rule 'runWithAnnotationExistsInParent' checks for each class in the project. If a class is annotated with '@RunWith', it then checks for each parent class in the class's hierarchy. If a parent class is also annotated with '@RunWith', it asserts that the parent class should not be annotated with '@RunWith'. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that both the parent and child classes are annotated with '@RunWith', which can lead to unexpected testing behavior.",,"The rule 'runWithAnnotationExistsInParent' is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses the built-in functions 'getClasses', 'hasAnnotation', 'getFamily', 'getFQN', and 'msg', which are all part of the RSL language. The rule does not introduce any new built-in functions.","1.
