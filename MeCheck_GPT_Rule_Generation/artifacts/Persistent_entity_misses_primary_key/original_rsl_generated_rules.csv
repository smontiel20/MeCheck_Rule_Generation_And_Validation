Java Persistence API (JPA),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/JpaMissingIdInspection.html,"The source page describes a rule that identifies and reports instances where persistent objects lack an identification property, which is crucial for their unique identification and retrieval in a database.","Rule persistent-entity-misses-primary-key {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    if (getAnnotated(c, ""@Entity"")) {
      assert ( exists(field f in getFields(c)) ( hasAnnotation(f, ""@Id"") ) ) {

      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'persistent-entity-misses-primary-key' checks all classes in the project. If a class is annotated with '@Entity', indicating it is a persistent entity, the rule asserts that there exists a field within the class that is annotated with '@Id'. The '@Id' annotation signifies that the field is a primary key. If such a field does not exist, the rule generates a message reporting that the persistent entity does not have a primary key, along with the fully qualified name of the class.",,"The rule is syntactically correct and adheres to the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions 'getClasses', 'getAnnotated', 'getFields', 'hasAnnotation', and 'getFQN'. The rule logic is sound as it correctly identifies persistent entities and checks for the existence of a primary key.","1. URL: https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-entities
