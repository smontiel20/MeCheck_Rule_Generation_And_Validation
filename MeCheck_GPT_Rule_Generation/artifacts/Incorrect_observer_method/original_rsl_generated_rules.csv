CDI,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/CdiObservesInspection.html,"The source URL provides information about a rule that checks for incorrect observer method definitions in CDI. The rule specifies that an observer method must contain only one @Observes parameter, cannot have parameters annotated with @Disposes, and cannot be annotated with @Inject and @Produces.","Rule incorrect-observer-method {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {

}","The rule 'incorrect-observer-method' checks all classes and their methods. If a method is annotated with '@Observes', it asserts that the method must have only one '@Observes' parameter, it should not have any parameter annotated with '@Disposes', and the method itself should not be annotated with '@Inject' and '@Produces'. If the method does not meet these conditions, it generates a message indicating the incorrect observer method and the class it belongs to.",,,"1.

Summary: This tutorial from Baeldung explains the basics of CDI including the usage of @Inject, @Produces, and observer methods. It also provides examples of how to use these annotations in a Java EE application.",
