  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'entity-attribute-association-annotation' checks all classes in the project. For each class, it checks all fields. If the type of the field is 'Entity', it asserts that the field has one of the association annotations: 'OneToOne', 'OneToMany', 'ManyToOne', or 'ManyToMany'. If the field does not have any of these annotations, it generates a message indicating that the entity attribute is not marked with an association annotation."
