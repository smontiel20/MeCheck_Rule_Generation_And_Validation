Java Persistence API (JPA),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/AssociationNotMarkedInspection.html,The JetBrains Inspectopedia page describes a rule that checks for associations in JPA entities that are not marked with corresponding annotations.,"Rule entity-attribute-association-annotation {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (field f in getFields(c)) {
      if (getType(f) == 'Entity') {
        assert ( hasAnnotation(f, 'OneToOne') OR hasAnnotation(f, 'OneToMany') OR hasAnnotation(f, 'ManyToOne') OR hasAnnotation(f, 'ManyToMany') ) {
          msg(""Entity attribute: %s in class: %s is not marked with association annotation"",
              getName(f), getFQN(c));
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'entity-attribute-association-annotation' checks all classes in the project. For each class, it checks all fields. If the type of the field is 'Entity', it asserts that the field has one of the association annotations: 'OneToOne', 'OneToMany', 'ManyToOne', or 'ManyToMany'. If the field does not have any of these annotations, it generates a message indicating that the entity attribute is not marked with an association annotation.",,"The rule is syntactically correct according to the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions: getClasses, getFields, getType, hasAnnotation, getName, and getFQN. The rule does not introduce any new built-in functions.","1. https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-associations: This Baeldung article provides a comprehensive guide to JPA associations, explaining the importance of marking entity attributes with the correct association annotations.
