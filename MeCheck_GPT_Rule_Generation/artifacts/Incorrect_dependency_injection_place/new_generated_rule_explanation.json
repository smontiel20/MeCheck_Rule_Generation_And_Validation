  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'incorrect-injection-place' checks all classes in the project. For each class, it checks all fields and methods. If a field is annotated with @Inject, it asserts that the field is not final, not static, and not annotated with @Produces. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating the field and class where the incorrect injection occurred. Similarly, for methods annotated with @Inject, it asserts that the method is not abstract, not static, and does not have parameters annotated with @Disposes or @Observes. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating the method and class where the incorrect injection occurred."
