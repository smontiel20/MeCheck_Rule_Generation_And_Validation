  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'superTearDownInFinally' checks all classes in the project. If a class has a method named 'tearDown', it checks whether 'super.tearDown()' is called inside this method and whether this call is inside a 'finally' block. If 'super.tearDown()' is not called inside a 'finally' block, it generates a message indicating the fully qualified name of the class where this issue occurs."
