Quarkus,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/QsUndeclaredPathMimeTypesInspection.html,"The source URL provides information about a potential issue in Quarkus applications where endpoint methods might not have the @Produces or @Consumes annotations. Quarkus uses these annotations to minimize the number of JAX-RS providers included in the native executable, thereby reducing its size. The page suggests annotating methods or the entire class with @Produces or @Consumes and specifying the target MIME types.","Rule undeclared_path_mime_types_inspection {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (hasAnnotation(m, '@Path')) {
        assert ( hasAnnotation(m, '@Produces') OR hasAnnotation(m, '@Consumes') ) {
          msg('Method: %s in class: %s does not have @Produces or @Consumes annotation', getName(m), getFQN(c));
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'undeclared_path_mime_types_inspection' checks all classes and their methods in the application. If a method has the '@Path' annotation, the rule asserts that it should also have either the '@Produces' or '@Consumes' annotation. If this is not the case, it generates a message indicating the method and class that violate this rule.",,,"1. URL: https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-json - This guide from the official Quarkus website provides information on how to use JAX-RS, JSON-B, and RESTEasy to create RESTful web services. It emphasizes the importance of using @Produces and @Consumes annotations to specify the MIME types that a method can consume and produce.
