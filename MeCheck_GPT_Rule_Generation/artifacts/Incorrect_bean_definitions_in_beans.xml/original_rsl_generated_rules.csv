Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/CdiDomBeans.html,"The JetBrains Inspectopedia page provides information about the CDI Dom Beans inspection, which reports incorrect bean definitions in beans.xml configuration files.","Rule incorrect-bean-definitions {

}","This rule, named 'incorrect-bean-definitions', checks all XML files for bean elements. For each bean element, it retrieves the fully qualified name of the bean class. If the bean class name is not empty, it asserts that the class either exists or is a library class. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating an incorrect bean definition, specifying the fully qualified name of the bean class and the name of the bean.",,"The rule is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions: getXMLs, elementExists, getElms, getAttr, isEmpty, classExists, isLibraryClass, and getName. The rule logic is sound as it checks for incorrect bean definitions in XML files, which aligns with the topic and content provided.","1. https://www.baeldung.com/cdi-qualifiers: This page from Baeldung provides a comprehensive guide on CDI qualifiers in Java, including how to define beans in beans.xml files.
