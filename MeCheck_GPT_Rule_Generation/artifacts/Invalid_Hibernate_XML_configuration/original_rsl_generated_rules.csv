}","The rule 'invalid-hibernate-xml-configuration' checks for errors in Hibernate XML configuration. It iterates over all XML files and checks for each class element. If the class name is not empty, it asserts that the class exists and is not a library class. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that the class is either non-instantiable, does not extend the required class, or has inappropriate scope. It also checks if the scope attribute of the class is empty and generates a message if it is. Furthermore, it checks if the class element includes the required children tags or attributes and generates a message if it does not. Finally, it checks if the class name is unique and generates a message if it is not.",,The generated rule is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions provided and does not introduce any new functions. The rule checks for various errors in Hibernate XML configuration as specified in the prompt.,"1.

Summary: This page discusses the differences between XML and annotation configurations in Hibernate. It mentions that XML configuration can be verbose and prone to errors, which aligns with the rule generated.

Summary: This page provides a tutorial on Hibernate XML mappings. It includes information on how to define classes, which is relevant to the rule generated that checks for errors in class definitions in Hibernate XML configuration.",,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31403203/mismatch-in-pathvariable-resolving; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15431180/configure-error-page-for-pathvariable-type-mismatch; https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/25846
