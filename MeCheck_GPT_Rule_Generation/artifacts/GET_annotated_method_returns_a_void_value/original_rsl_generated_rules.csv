RESTful Web Service (JAX-RS),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/VoidMethodAnnotatedWithGET.html,"The source URL provides information about a common issue in RESTful Web Services where methods annotated with @GET do not return anything. According to the source, methods annotated with @GET must have a non-void return type.","Rule voidMethodAnnotatedWithGET {
  for (class c in getClasses()) {
    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (hasAnnotation(m, '@GET')) {
        assert (NOT getReturnType(m) == 'void') {
          msg('Method: %s in class: %s annotated with @GET returns void', getName(m), getFQN(c));
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'voidMethodAnnotatedWithGET' checks all classes and their methods. If a method is annotated with @GET, it asserts that the return type of the method is not void. If the return type is void, it generates a message indicating the method and class where this issue occurs.","The rule uses the following built-in functions: getClasses, getMethods, hasAnnotation, getReturnType, getName, getFQN. No new functions were introduced.",,"1. https://www.baeldung.com/jax-rs-response: This page from Baeldung discusses how to properly use the @GET annotation in JAX-RS. It emphasizes that methods annotated with @GET should return a Response object, not void.
2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20193003/how-to-return-nothing-with-a-get-restful-service-method: This StackOverflow thread discusses the issue of methods returning void in a RESTful service. The consensus is that it's not good practice for a method with a @GET annotation to return void.",
