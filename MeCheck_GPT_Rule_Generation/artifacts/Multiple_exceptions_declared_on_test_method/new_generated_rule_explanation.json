  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'multiple_exceptions_declared_on_test_method' checks all classes and their methods. If a method starts with 'test' and its return type is 'void' (indicating it's a test method), it retrieves the exceptions declared in the method's throws clause. If the number of exceptions is more than one, it asserts a failure and generates a message suggesting to replace the multiple exceptions with a single exception."
