  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'pointcut-expression-errors' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has a 'Pointcut' annotation, it retrieves the pointcut expression from the annotation's 'value' attribute. If the pointcut expression is not empty, it asserts that the expression either exists as a method call or a class. If the assertion fails, it means the pointcut expression is unresolved or has incompatible arguments, and a message is generated with the details."
