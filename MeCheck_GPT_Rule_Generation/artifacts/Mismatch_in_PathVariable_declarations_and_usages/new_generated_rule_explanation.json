  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'pathVariableMismatch' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has the '@PathVariable' annotation, it retrieves the name of the path variable and the URL path from the '@RequestMapping' annotation. It then asserts that the URL path contains the path variable name. If it does not, a message is generated indicating the mismatch, including the method name, class fully qualified name, path variable name, and URL path."
