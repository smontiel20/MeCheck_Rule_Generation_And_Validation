  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'ManyToManyCascadeRemove' checks all classes in the application. For each class, it checks if it has a @ManyToMany annotation. If it does, it then checks all fields of the class. For each field, it checks if it has a @ManyToMany annotation. If it does, it retrieves the 'cascade' attribute of the annotation. It then asserts that the 'cascade' attribute is not 'REMOVE' or 'ALL'. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that the field in the class has a @ManyToMany association with CascadeType.REMOVE or CascadeType.ALL, which can lead to a ConstraintViolationException."
