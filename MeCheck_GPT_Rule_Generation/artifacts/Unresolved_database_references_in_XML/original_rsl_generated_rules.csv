Java Persistence API (JPA),https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/JpaDataSourceORMDomInspection.html,The source URL provides information about a JetBrains Inspectopedia rule that reports Persistence ORM XML descriptors that cannot be resolved within the configured datasource. It suggests refreshing the datasource or assigning a different one.,"Rule unresolved-database-references {
  for (file xml in getXMLs()) {
    if (elementExists(xml, ""<persistence-unit>"")) {
      for (<persistence-unit> unit in getElms(xml, ""<persistence-unit>"")) {
        String dataSource = getAttr(unit, ""jta-data-source"");
        if (NOT isEmpty(dataSource)) {
          assert ( classExists(dataSource) OR isLibraryClass(dataSource) ) {
            msg(""Data source: %s mentioned in persistence unit: %s, cannot be resolved"",
                dataSource, getName(unit));
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}","The rule 'unresolved-database-references' checks all XML files for the existence of '<persistence-unit>' elements. For each persistence unit, it retrieves the 'jta-data-source' attribute, which should represent a data source. If the data source is not empty, the rule asserts that the data source either exists as a class or is a library class. If the data source cannot be resolved, it generates a message indicating the data source and the persistence unit where it was mentioned.",,"The generated rule follows the syntax of RSL and uses only the built-in functions. It does not introduce any new functions. The rule checks for unresolved data sources in persistence units within XML files, which aligns with the topic and content provided.","1. https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persistence-xml: This page provides a comprehensive guide to the persistence.xml file in JPA, including the configuration of the 'persistence-unit' and 'jta-data-source' elements, which are relevant to the generated rule.
2. https://www.objectdb.com/java/jpa/connection/database: This page discusses how to connect to a database in JPA, including the use of data sources, which is the main focus of the generated rule.",
