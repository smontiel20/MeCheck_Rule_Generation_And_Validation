}","The rule 'illegal-method-name-dependsOnMethods' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has the @Test annotation, it retrieves the 'dependsOnMethods' attribute. For each method name in 'dependsOnMethods', it asserts that there exists a method in the same class with the same name and the @Test annotation. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating the illegal method name, the method where it was found, and the class containing the method.",,"The generated rule appears to be syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions provided, and it seems to correctly implement the logic described in the JetBrains Inspectopedia page.","1. URL: https://www.toolsqa.com/testng/testng-dependency-test/
Summary: This page explains the 'dependsOnMethods' attribute in TestNG, which allows one test method to depend on another. If the method that a test depends on fails or is skipped, then the dependent test will not be executed.

2. URL: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/testng/testng_dependency_test.htm
Summary: This page also explains the 'dependsOnMethods' attribute in TestNG, emphasizing that it helps in managing test cases and their dependencies, which is crucial for the execution order of test methods.",
