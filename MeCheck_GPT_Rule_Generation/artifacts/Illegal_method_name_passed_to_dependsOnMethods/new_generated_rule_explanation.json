  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'illegal-method-name-dependsOnMethods' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has the @Test annotation, it retrieves the 'dependsOnMethods' attribute. For each method name in 'dependsOnMethods', it asserts that there exists a method in the same class with the same name and the @Test annotation. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating the illegal method name, the method where it was found, and the class containing the method."
