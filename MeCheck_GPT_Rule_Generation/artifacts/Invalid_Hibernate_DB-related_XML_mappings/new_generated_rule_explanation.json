  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'invalid-hibernate-db-xml-mappings' checks for unresolved symbols in named and native queries in Hibernate XML mappings. It iterates over all XML files and checks for the existence of '<named-query>' elements. For each named query, it asserts that the query name exists as a callable function. If it doesn't, it reports an error message. It also checks for '<query-param>' elements within each named query and asserts that each query parameter exists within the named query. If it doesn't, it reports an error message."
