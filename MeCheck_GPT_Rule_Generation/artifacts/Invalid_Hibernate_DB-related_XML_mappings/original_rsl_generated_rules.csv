Hibernate,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/JpaQueryApiInspection.html,The source URL provides information about a JetBrains inspection tool that reports unresolved symbols in named and native queries and related API methods. It specifically identifies issues with unknown named queries and unknown query parameters.,"Rule invalid-hibernate-db-xml-mappings {
  for (file xml in getXMLs()) {
    if (elementExists(xml, ""<named-query>"")) {
      for (<named-query> namedQuery in getElms(xml, ""<named-query>"")) {
        String queryName = getAttr(namedQuery, ""name"");

}","The rule 'invalid-hibernate-db-xml-mappings' checks for unresolved symbols in named and native queries in Hibernate XML mappings. It iterates over all XML files and checks for the existence of '<named-query>' elements. For each named query, it asserts that the query name exists as a callable function. If it doesn't, it reports an error message. It also checks for '<query-param>' elements within each named query and asserts that each query parameter exists within the named query. If it doesn't, it reports an error message.",,"The generated rule is syntactically correct and follows the RSL syntax. It uses only the built-in functions provided, such as 'getXMLs', 'elementExists', 'getElms', 'getAttr', 'callExists', 'hasParam', and 'getName'. The rule logic is sound and should correctly identify unresolved symbols in named and native queries in Hibernate XML mappings.","1.
