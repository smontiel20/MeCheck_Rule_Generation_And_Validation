Java-Verbose,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/LombokGetterMayBeUsed.html,The source URL provides information about a rule that reports standard getter methods in Java that can be replaced by the Lombok @Getter annotation. The rule only applies when the Lombok library is configured in the project. The page also provides a link to the Lombok site for more information on how to unlombok.,"Rule lombok-getter-may-be-used {

    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (startsWith(getName(m), ""get"") AND hasAnnotation(c, ""lombok.Getter"") == false) {

  }
}","The rule 'lombok-getter-may-be-used' checks all classes in the project. For each class, it checks all methods. If a method's name starts with 'get' and the class does not have the Lombok @Getter annotation, it asserts that the return type of the method is the same as the type of the method. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that the standard getter method can be replaced by the Lombok @Getter annotation.",,,"1. URL: https://projectlombok.org/features/Getter
