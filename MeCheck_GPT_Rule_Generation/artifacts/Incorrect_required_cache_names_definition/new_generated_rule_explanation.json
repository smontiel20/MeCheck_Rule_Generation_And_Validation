  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'incorrect-cache-names-definition' checks all classes in the project. If a class has either the @Cacheable or @CacheConfig annotation, it retrieves the cacheNames attribute from the annotation. It then asserts that the first cache name is not empty. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating that the cache name definition in the class is incorrect and that at least one cache name should be provided per cache operation."
