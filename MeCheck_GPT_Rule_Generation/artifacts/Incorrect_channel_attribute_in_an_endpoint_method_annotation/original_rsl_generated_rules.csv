}","The rule 'incorrect-channel-attribute' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has either @Gateway, @ServiceActivator, or @Filter annotation, it retrieves the 'channel' attribute from the annotation. If the 'channel' attribute is not empty, it asserts that a field with the same name as the 'channel' attribute exists in the class. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating the incorrect 'channel' attribute in the method of the class.",,,"https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/docs/current/reference/html/messaging-endpoints-chapter.html: This page provides detailed information about messaging endpoints in Spring Integration, including the use of @Gateway, @ServiceActivator, and @Filter annotations and their 'channel' attributes.
