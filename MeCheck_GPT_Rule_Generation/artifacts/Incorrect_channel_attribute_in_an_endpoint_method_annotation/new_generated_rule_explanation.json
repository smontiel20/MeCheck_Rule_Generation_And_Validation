  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'incorrect-channel-attribute' checks all classes and their methods. If a method has either @Gateway, @ServiceActivator, or @Filter annotation, it retrieves the 'channel' attribute from the annotation. If the 'channel' attribute is not empty, it asserts that a field with the same name as the 'channel' attribute exists in the class. If the assertion fails, it generates a message indicating the incorrect 'channel' attribute in the method of the class."
