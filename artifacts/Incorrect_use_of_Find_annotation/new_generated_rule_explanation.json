  "new_generated_rule_explanation": "The rule 'incorrect-use-of-find-annotation' checks for incorrect usage of the @Find annotation in Hibernate. It iterates over all classes and their methods. If a method has the @Find annotation, it checks if the return type of the method is one of the valid types. If not, it generates a message indicating the error. It also checks if the names and types of the method's parameters match exactly with the names and types of the persistent fields of the class. If not, it generates a message indicating the error."
