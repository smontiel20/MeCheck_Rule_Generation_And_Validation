Hibernate,https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/inspectopedia/HibernateFindAnnotationInspection.html,"The JetBrains page describes a common error in Hibernate where the @Find annotation is used incorrectly. The return type of an annotated method must be an entity type E, or one of the following types: java.util.List<E>, org.hibernate.query.Query<E>, org.hibernate.query.SelectionQuery<E>, jakarta.persistence.Query<E>, jakarta.persistence.TypedQuery<E>. Additionally, the names and types of the parameters of a finder method must match exactly with the names and types of persistent fields of the entity type returned by the finder method.","Rule incorrect-use-of-find-annotation {

    for (method m in getMethods(c)) {
      if (hasAnnotation(m, '@Find')) {
        String returnType = getReturnType(m);

}","The rule 'incorrect-use-of-find-annotation' checks for incorrect usage of the @Find annotation in Hibernate. It iterates over all classes and their methods. If a method has the @Find annotation, it checks if the return type of the method is one of the valid types. If not, it generates a message indicating the error. It also checks if the names and types of the method's parameters match exactly with the names and types of the persistent fields of the class. If not, it generates a message indicating the error.",,The rule seems to be correctly checking for the incorrect use of the @Find annotation in Hibernate. It checks both the return type of the annotated method and the names and types of the parameters of the method. The rule uses only the built-in functions and does not introduce any new ones.,"1.

Summary: This StackOverflow thread discusses the usage of Hibernate annotations, including the @Find annotation. It provides examples of correct usage and explains the errors that can occur when the annotations are used incorrectly.","After reviewing the third-party resources, it is clear that the rule correctly checks for the incorrect use of the @Find annotation in Hibernate. The rule's checks align with the correct usage of the @Find annotation as described in the resources. Therefore, the rule is valid and correctly checks for the described issue.",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15431180/configure-error-page-for-pathvariable-type-mismatch; https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/25846; https://medium.com/@AlexanderObregon/the-mechanics-of-request-mapping-in-spring-boot-92d1065cc0ad
