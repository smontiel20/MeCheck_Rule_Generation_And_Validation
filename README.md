Repository is a duplicate of MeCheck engine with new rules and code snippets implemented and bash application of our pipeline under "MeCheck_GPT_Rule_Generation".

Inside our pipeline should be a README folder explaining how to run it.

In "artifact-submission" new rule folders have been created for each library/framework we created rules for. The "dataset" folder holds corresponding folders which contain code snippets to test each library/framework. The "output" folder holds the output files when you run each of the rules under this current implementation
